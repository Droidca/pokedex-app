# pokedex-app
This is a pokedex-app I did for my Achievement 1 of the CareerFoundry Course. It has every pokemon from Gen 1, and by clicking the name of the desired pokemon, in the scrollbox, a modal appears with the pokemon details.

To exit the details and select another pokemon, just press escape key or click outside of modal windows.

I used bootstrap for CSS and Javascpript, however, I did some costume styling for the app to look better, and work responsive on tablets and mobile devices.
