# pokedex-app
This is a pokedex-app I did for my Achievement 1 of the CareerFoundry Course, with every pokemon from Gen 1.

To use the app, click the name of the desired pokemon, in the scrollbox (inside the left screen of the pokedex). Doing so will reveal a modal with that pokemon's details on the right side of the pokedex, or in the middle of the page, if you are on mobile. To exit the details modal and select another pokemon, simply press escape key or click outside of the modal window.

In order to obtain pokemon names and details, the app calls the API https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/?limit=151.

This app was built using javascript version ES6, with the following linter rules:

{ "env": { "es6": true, "browser": true }, "extends": [ "eslint:recommended" ], "rules": { "quotes": ["error", "single"] } }

I also used CSS version W3.CSS 4.15 and HTML5.

This app relies bootstrap for CSS and Javascpript aswell, however, I did some costume styling for the app to look better, and work responsive on tablets and mobile devices.
